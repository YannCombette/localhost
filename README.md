# localhost
this will be the template of my localhost



to use this app properly, you have to go on move the index add the localhose folder to you main localhost root folder; than move the index.php from the localhost folder to your root folder.

to make the app work, you will have to modify:

index.php:

under " //! --------- this is the page display --------- ", you will have to uncomment the reqire, and comment the one that is not nessesary.

header.tpl.php:

under " //! --------- this is the data needed --------- ", you will have to comment the uncomented include, and uncomment the other .

data.php:

in data you will have to do the same as above for: $directory, $daysPath and $exosPath.
